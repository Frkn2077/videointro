# Instagram Intro Video Project

This project creates a 9:16 Instagram Intro video using Remotion.

## Prerequisite
You need to install the dependencies. I attempted to do this but encountered network/registry issues.

Please run this command in your terminal manually:
```bash
npm install
```

## Running the Project
To start the preview studio:
```bash
npm start
```

## Rendering the Video
To render the video to an MP4 file:
```bash
npm run build
```
The output video will be in `out/video.mp4`.

## Customization
1. **User Image**: Replace the placeholder image in `src/Avatar.tsx` or place your image in the `public` folder.
2. **Music**: Place your "One Piece Overtaken" music file in the `public` folder (e.g., `public/overtaken.mp3`).
